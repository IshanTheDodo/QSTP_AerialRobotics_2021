# Basic Python Programming
The main content for this week is `Python Programming`. The resources for this week are attached in the [RESOURCES](RESOURCES.md) file. 

- There is a Python Notebook given in for this Week. This notebook aims to introduce basic concepts of Python. To use this notebook, you will need to open it in Colab. Any changes you make cannot be saved. Hence you need to make a copy of it and save it to your drive. 
- Here are some instructions on using a Colab Notebook:
